## Core Workflow

### Phase 1: Capturing Network Traffic

#### Start Live Capture
Begin capturing packets on network interface:

```
1. Launch Wireshark
2. Select network interface from main screen
3. Click shark fin icon or double-click interface
4. Capture begins immediately
```

#### Capture Controls
| Action | Shortcut | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Start/Stop Capture | Ctrl+E | Toggle capture on/off |
| Restart Capture | Ctrl+R | Stop and start new capture |
| Open PCAP File | Ctrl+O | Load existing capture file |
| Save Capture | Ctrl+S | Save current capture |

#### Capture Filters
Apply filters before capture to limit data collection:

```
# Capture only specific host
host 192.168.1.100

# Capture specific port
port 80

# Capture specific network
net 192.168.1.0/24

# Exclude specific traffic
not arp

# Combine filters
host 192.168.1.100 and port 443
```

### Phase 2: Display Filters

#### Basic Filter Syntax
Filter captured packets for analysis:

```
# IP address filters
ip.addr == 192.168.1.1              # All traffic to/from IP
ip.src == 192.168.1.1               # Source IP only
ip.dst == 192.168.1.1               # Destination IP only

# Port filters
tcp.port == 80                       # TCP port 80
udp.port == 53                       # UDP port 53
tcp.dstport == 443                   # Destination port 443
tcp.srcport == 22                    # Source port 22
```

#### Protocol Filters
Filter by specific protocols:

```
# Common protocols
http                                  # HTTP traffic
https or ssl or tls                   # Encrypted web traffic
dns                                   # DNS queries and responses
ftp                                   # FTP traffic
ssh                                   # SSH traffic
icmp                                  # Ping/ICMP traffic
arp                                   # ARP requests/responses
dhcp                                  # DHCP traffic
smb or smb2                          # SMB file sharing
```

#### TCP Flag Filters
Identify specific connection states:

```
tcp.flags.syn == 1                   # SYN packets (connection attempts)
tcp.flags.ack == 1                   # ACK packets
tcp.flags.fin == 1                   # FIN packets (connection close)
tcp.flags.reset == 1                 # RST packets (connection reset)
tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 0  # SYN-only (initial connection)
```

#### Content Filters
Search for specific content:

```
frame contains "password"            # Packets containing string
http.request.uri contains "login"    # HTTP URIs with string
tcp contains "GET"                   # TCP packets with string
```

#### Analysis Filters
Identify potential issues:

```
tcp.analysis.retransmission          # TCP retransmissions
tcp.analysis.duplicate_ack           # Duplicate ACKs
tcp.analysis.zero_window             # Zero window (flow control)
tcp.analysis.flags                   # Packets with issues
dns.flags.rcode != 0                 # DNS errors
```

#### Combining Filters
Use logical operators for complex queries:

```
# AND operator
ip.addr == 192.168.1.1 && tcp.port == 80

# OR operator
dns || http

# NOT operator
!(arp || icmp)

# Complex combinations
(ip.src == 192.168.1.1 || ip.src == 192.168.1.2) && tcp.port == 443
```

### Phase 3: Following Streams

#### TCP Stream Reconstruction
View complete TCP conversation:

```
1. Right-click on any TCP packet
2. Select Follow > TCP Stream
3. View reconstructed conversation
4. Toggle between ASCII, Hex, Raw views
5. Filter to show only this stream
```

#### Stream Types
| Stream | Access | Use Case |
|--------|--------|----------|
| TCP Stream | Follow > TCP Stream | Web, file transfers, any TCP |
| UDP Stream | Follow > UDP Stream | DNS, VoIP, streaming |
| HTTP Stream | Follow > HTTP Stream | Web content, headers |
| TLS Stream | Follow > TLS Stream | Encrypted traffic (if keys available) |

#### Stream Analysis Tips
- Review request/response pairs
- Identify transmitted files or data
- Look for credentials in plaintext
- Note unusual patterns or commands

### Phase 4: Statistical Analysis

#### Protocol Hierarchy
View protocol distribution:

```
Statistics > Protocol Hierarchy

Shows:
- Percentage of each protocol
- Packet counts
- Bytes transferred
- Protocol breakdown tree
```

#### Conversations
Analyze communication pairs:

```
Statistics > Conversations

Tabs:
- Ethernet: MAC address pairs
- IPv4/IPv6: IP address pairs
- TCP: Connection details (ports, bytes, packets)
- UDP: Datagram exchanges
```

#### Endpoints
View active network participants:

```
Statistics > Endpoints

Shows:
- All source/destination addresses
- Packet and byte counts
- Geographic information (if enabled)
```

#### Flow Graph
Visualize packet sequence:

```
Statistics > Flow Graph

Options:
- All packets or displayed only
- Standard or TCP flow
- Shows packet timing and direction
```

#### I/O Graphs
Plot traffic over time:

```
Statistics > I/O Graph

Features:
- Packets per second
- Bytes per second
- Custom filter graphs
- Multiple graph overlays
```

### Phase 5: Security Analysis

#### Detect Port Scanning
Identify reconnaissance activity:

```
# SYN scan detection (many ports, same source)
ip.src == SUSPECT_IP && tcp.flags.syn == 1

# Review Statistics > Conversations for anomalies
# Look for single source hitting many destination ports
```

#### Identify Suspicious Traffic
Filter for anomalies:

```
# Traffic to unusual ports
tcp.dstport > 1024 && tcp.dstport < 49152

# Traffic outside trusted network
!(ip.addr == 192.168.1.0/24)

# Unusual DNS queries
dns.qry.name contains "suspicious-domain"

# Large data transfers
frame.len > 1400
```

#### ARP Spoofing Detection
Identify ARP attacks:

```
# Duplicate ARP responses
arp.duplicate-address-frame

# ARP traffic analysis
arp

# Look for:
# - Multiple MACs for same IP
# - Gratuitous ARP floods
# - Unusual ARP patterns
```

#### Examine Downloads
Analyze file transfers:

```
# HTTP file downloads
http.request.method == "GET" && http contains "Content-Disposition"

# Follow HTTP Stream to view file content
# Use File > Export Objects > HTTP to extract files
```

#### DNS Analysis
Investigate DNS activity:

```
# All DNS traffic
dns

# DNS queries only
dns.flags.response == 0

# DNS responses only
dns.flags.response == 1

# Failed DNS lookups
dns.flags.rcode != 0

# Specific domain queries
dns.qry.name contains "domain.com"
```

## Constraints and Guardrails

### Operational Boundaries
- Capture only authorized network traffic
- Handle captured data according to privacy policies
- Avoid capturing sensitive credentials unnecessarily
- Properly secure PCAP files containing sensitive data

### Technical Limitations
- Large captures consume significant memory
- Encrypted traffic content not visible without keys
- High-speed networks may drop packets
- Some protocols require plugins for full decoding

### Best Practices
- Use capture filters to limit data collection
- Save captures regularly during long sessions
- Use display filters rather than deleting packets
- Document analysis findings and methodology

## Examples

### Example 1: HTTP Credential Analysis

**Scenario**: Investigate potential plaintext credential transmission

```
1. Filter: http.request.method == "POST"
2. Look for login forms
3. Follow HTTP Stream
4. Search for username/password parameters
```

**Finding**: Credentials transmitted in cleartext form data.

### Example 2: Malware C2 Detection

**Scenario**: Identify command and control traffic

```
1. Filter: dns
2. Look for unusual query patterns
3. Check for high-frequency beaconing
4. Identify domains with random-looking names
5. Filter: ip.dst == SUSPICIOUS_IP
6. Analyze traffic patterns
```

**Indicators**:
- Regular timing intervals
- Encoded/encrypted payloads
- Unusual ports or protocols

### Example 3: Network Troubleshooting

**Scenario**: Diagnose slow web application

```
1. Filter: ip.addr == WEB_SERVER
2. Check Statistics > Service Response Time
3. Filter: tcp.analysis.retransmission
4. Review I/O Graph for patterns
5. Check for high latency or packet loss
```

**Finding**: TCP retransmissions indicating network congestion.

## Troubleshooting

### No Packets Captured
- Verify correct interface selected
- Check for admin/root permissions
- Confirm network adapter is active
- Disable promiscuous mode if issues persist

### Filter Not Working
- Verify filter syntax (red = error)
- Check for typos in field names
- Use Expression button for valid fields
- Clear filter and rebuild incrementally

### Performance Issues
- Use capture filters to limit traffic
- Split large captures into smaller files
- Disable name resolution during capture
- Close unnecessary protocol dissectors

### Cannot Decrypt TLS/SSL
- Obtain server private key
- Configure at Edit > Preferences > Protocols > TLS
- For ephemeral keys, capture pre-master secret from browser
- Some modern ciphers cannot be decrypted passively
