## Anti-Patterns

### ❌ Building Without Audience

**Why bad**: No one knows about you.
Launch to crickets.
No email list.
No social following.

**Instead**: Build audience first.
Share work publicly.
Give away free templates.
Grow email list.

### ❌ Too Niche or Too Broad

**Why bad**: "Notion template" = too vague.
"Notion for left-handed fishermen" = too niche.
No clear buyer.
Weak positioning.

**Instead**: Specific but sizable market.
"Notion for freelancers"
"Notion for students"
"Notion for small teams"

### ❌ No Support System

**Why bad**: Support requests pile up.
Bad reviews.
Refund requests.
Stressful.

**Instead**: Great documentation.
Video walkthrough.
FAQ page.
Email/chat for premium.
