## Ad Copy Frameworks

### Primary Text Formulas

**Problem-Agitate-Solve (PAS):**
```
[Problem statement]
[Agitate the pain]
[Introduce solution]
[CTA]
```

Example:
> Spending hours on manual reporting every week?
> While you're buried in spreadsheets, your competitors are making decisions.
> [Product] automates your reports in minutes.
> Start your free trial →

**Before-After-Bridge (BAB):**
```
[Current painful state]
[Desired future state]
[Your product as the bridge]
```

Example:
> Before: Chasing down approvals across email, Slack, and spreadsheets.
> After: Every approval tracked, automated, and on time.
> [Product] connects your tools and keeps projects moving.

**Social Proof Lead:**
```
[Impressive stat or testimonial]
[What you do]
[CTA]
```

Example:
> "We cut our reporting time by 75%." — Sarah K., Marketing Director
> [Product] automates the reports you hate building.
> See how it works →

### Headline Formulas

## Audience Targeting Strategies

### Google Ads Audiences

**Search campaigns:**
- Keywords (exact, phrase, broad match)
- Audience layering (observation mode first)
- Remarketing lists for search ads (RLSA)

**Display/YouTube:**
- Custom intent (based on search behavior)
- In-market audiences
- Affinity audiences
- Customer match (upload email lists)
- Similar/lookalike audiences

### Meta Audiences

**Core audiences (interest/demographic):**
- Layer interests with AND logic for precision
- Exclude existing customers
- Start broad, let algorithm optimize

**Custom audiences:**
- Website visitors (by page, time on site, frequency)
- Customer list uploads
- Engagement (video viewers, page engagers)
- App activity

**Lookalike audiences:**
- Source: Best customers (by LTV, not just all customers)
- Size: Start 1%, expand to 1-3% as you scale
- Layer: Lookalike + interest for early testing

### LinkedIn Audiences

**Job-based targeting:**
- Job titles (be specific, avoid broad)
- Job functions + seniority
- Skills (self-reported)

**Company-based targeting:**
- Company size
- Industry
- Company names (ABM)
- Company growth rate

**Combinations that work:**
- Job function + seniority + company size
- Industry + job title

## Creative Best Practices

### Image Ads

**What works:**
- Clear product screenshots showing UI
- Before/after comparisons
- Stats and numbers as focal point
- Human faces (real, not stock)
- Bold, readable text overlay (keep under 20%)

**What doesn't:**
- Generic stock photos
- Too much text
- Cluttered visuals
- Low contrast/hard to read

### Video Ads

**Structure for short-form (15-30 sec):**
1. Hook (0-3 sec): Pattern interrupt, question, or bold statement
2. Problem (3-8 sec): Relatable pain point
3. Solution (8-20 sec): Show product/benefit
4. CTA (20-30 sec): Clear next step

**Structure for longer-form (60+ sec):**
1. Hook (0-5 sec)
2. Problem deep-dive (5-20 sec)
3. Solution introduction (20-35 sec)
4. Social proof (35-45 sec)
5. How it works (45-55 sec)
6. CTA with offer (55-60 sec)

**Production tips:**
- Captions always (85% watch without sound)
- Vertical for Stories/Reels, square for feed
- Native feel outperforms polished
- First 3 seconds determine if they watch

### Ad Creative Testing

**Testing hierarchy:**
1. Concept/angle (biggest impact)
2. Hook/headline
3. Visual style
4. Body copy
5. CTA

**Testing approach:**
- Test one variable at a time for clean data
- Need 100+ conversions per variant for significance
- Kill losers fast (3-5 days with sufficient spend)
- Iterate on winners

## Campaign Optimization

### Key Metrics by Objective

**Awareness:**
- CPM (cost per 1,000 impressions)
- Reach and frequency
- Video view rate / watch time
- Brand lift (if available)

**Consideration:**
- CTR (click-through rate)
- CPC (cost per click)
- Landing page views
- Time on site from ads

**Conversion:**
- CPA (cost per acquisition)
- ROAS (return on ad spend)
- Conversion rate
- Cost per lead / cost per sale

### Optimization Levers

**If CPA is too high:**
1. Check landing page (is the problem post-click?)
2. Tighten audience targeting
3. Test new creative angles
4. Improve ad relevance/quality score
5. Adjust bid strategy

**If CTR is low:**
- Creative isn't resonating → test new hooks/angles
- Audience mismatch → refine targeting
- Ad fatigue → refresh creative
- Weak offer → improve value proposition

**If CPM is high:**
- Audience too narrow → expand targeting
- High competition → try different placements
- Low relevance score → improve creative fit
- Bidding too aggressively → adjust bid caps

### Bid Strategies

**Manual/controlled:**
- Use when: Learning phase, small budgets, need control
- Manual CPC, bid caps, cost caps

**Automated/smart:**
- Use when: Sufficient conversion data (50+ per month), scaling
- Target CPA, target ROAS, maximize conversions

**Progression:**
1. Start with manual or cost caps
2. Gather conversion data (50+ conversions)
3. Switch to automated with targets based on historical data
4. Monitor and adjust targets based on results

## Retargeting Strategies

### Funnel-Based Retargeting

**Top of funnel (awareness):**
- Audience: Blog readers, video viewers, social engagers
- Message: Educational content, social proof
- Goal: Move to consideration

**Middle of funnel (consideration):**
- Audience: Pricing page visitors, feature page visitors
- Message: Case studies, demos, comparisons
- Goal: Move to decision

**Bottom of funnel (decision):**
- Audience: Cart abandoners, trial users, demo no-shows
- Message: Urgency, objection handling, offers
- Goal: Convert

### Retargeting Windows

| Stage | Window | Frequency Cap |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| Hot (cart/trial) | 1-7 days | Higher OK |
| Warm (key pages) | 7-30 days | 3-5x/week |
| Cold (any visit) | 30-90 days | 1-2x/week |

### Exclusions to Set Up

Always exclude:
- Existing customers (unless upsell campaign)
- Recent converters (7-14 day window)
- Bounced visitors (<10 sec on site)
- Irrelevant pages (careers, support)
