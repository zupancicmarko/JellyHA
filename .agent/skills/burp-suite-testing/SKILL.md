## Core Workflow

### Phase 1: Intercepting HTTP Traffic

#### Launch Burp's Browser
Navigate to integrated browser for seamless proxy integration:

1. Open Burp Suite and create/open project
2. Go to **Proxy > Intercept** tab
3. Click **Open Browser** to launch preconfigured browser
4. Position windows to view both Burp and browser simultaneously

#### Configure Interception
Control which requests are captured:

```
Proxy > Intercept > Intercept is on/off toggle

When ON: Requests pause for review/modification
When OFF: Requests pass through, logged to history
```

#### Intercept and Forward Requests
Process intercepted traffic:

1. Set intercept toggle to **Intercept on**
2. Navigate to target URL in browser
3. Observe request held in Proxy > Intercept tab
4. Review request contents (headers, parameters, body)
5. Click **Forward** to send request to server
6. Continue forwarding subsequent requests until page loads

#### View HTTP History
Access complete traffic log:

1. Go to **Proxy > HTTP history** tab
2. Click any entry to view full request/response
3. Sort by clicking column headers (# for chronological order)
4. Use filters to focus on relevant traffic

### Phase 2: Modifying Requests

#### Intercept and Modify
Change request parameters before forwarding:

1. Enable interception: **Intercept on**
2. Trigger target request in browser
3. Locate parameter to modify in intercepted request
4. Edit value directly in request editor
5. Click **Forward** to send modified request

#### Common Modification Targets
| Target | Example | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Price parameters | `price=1` | Test business logic |
| User IDs | `userId=admin` | Test access control |
| Quantity values | `qty=-1` | Test input validation |
| Hidden fields | `isAdmin=true` | Test privilege escalation |

#### Example: Price Manipulation

```http
POST /cart HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

productId=1&quantity=1&price=100

# Modify to:
productId=1&quantity=1&price=1
```

Result: Item added to cart at modified price.

### Phase 3: Setting Target Scope

#### Define Scope
Focus testing on specific target:

1. Go to **Target > Site map**
2. Right-click target host in left panel
3. Select **Add to scope**
4. When prompted, click **Yes** to exclude out-of-scope traffic

#### Filter by Scope
Remove noise from HTTP history:

1. Click display filter above HTTP history
2. Select **Show only in-scope items**
3. History now shows only target site traffic

#### Scope Benefits
- Reduces clutter from third-party requests
- Prevents accidental testing of out-of-scope sites
- Improves scanning efficiency
- Creates cleaner reports

### Phase 4: Using Burp Repeater

#### Send Request to Repeater
Prepare request for manual testing:

1. Identify interesting request in HTTP history
2. Right-click request and select **Send to Repeater**
3. Go to **Repeater** tab to access request

#### Modify and Resend
Test different inputs efficiently:

```
1. View request in Repeater tab
2. Modify parameter values
3. Click Send to submit request
4. Review response in right panel
5. Use navigation arrows to review request history
```

#### Repeater Testing Workflow

```
Original Request:
GET /product?productId=1 HTTP/1.1

Test 1: productId=2    → Valid product response
Test 2: productId=999  → Not Found response  
Test 3: productId='    → Error/exception response
Test 4: productId=1 OR 1=1 → SQL injection test
```

#### Analyze Responses
Look for indicators of vulnerabilities:

- Error messages revealing stack traces
- Framework/version information disclosure
- Different response lengths indicating logic flaws
- Timing differences suggesting blind injection
- Unexpected data in responses

### Phase 5: Running Automated Scans

#### Launch New Scan
Initiate vulnerability scanning (Professional only):

1. Go to **Dashboard** tab
2. Click **New scan**
3. Enter target URL in **URLs to scan** field
4. Configure scan settings

#### Scan Configuration Options

| Mode | Description | Duration |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Lightweight | High-level overview | ~15 minutes |
| Fast | Quick vulnerability check | ~30 minutes |
| Balanced | Standard comprehensive scan | ~1-2 hours |
| Deep | Thorough testing | Several hours |

#### Monitor Scan Progress
Track scanning activity:

1. View task status in **Dashboard**
2. Watch **Target > Site map** update in real-time
3. Check **Issues** tab for discovered vulnerabilities

#### Review Identified Issues
Analyze scan findings:

1. Select scan task in Dashboard
2. Go to **Issues** tab
3. Click issue to view:
   - **Advisory**: Description and remediation
   - **Request**: Triggering HTTP request
   - **Response**: Server response showing vulnerability

### Phase 6: Intruder Attacks

#### Configure Intruder
Set up automated attack:

1. Send request to Intruder (right-click > Send to Intruder)
2. Go to **Intruder** tab
3. Define payload positions using § markers
4. Select attack type

#### Attack Types

| Type | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Sniper | Single position, iterate payloads | Fuzzing one parameter |
| Battering ram | Same payload all positions | Credential testing |
| Pitchfork | Parallel payload iteration | Username:password pairs |
| Cluster bomb | All payload combinations | Full brute force |

#### Configure Payloads

```
Positions Tab:
POST /login HTTP/1.1
...
username=§admin§&password=§password§

Payloads Tab:
Set 1: admin, user, test, guest
Set 2: password, 123456, admin, letmein
```

#### Analyze Results
Review attack output:

- Sort by response length to find anomalies
- Filter by status code for successful attempts
- Use grep to search for specific strings
- Export results for documentation

| cat /etc/passwd
`whoami`
```

### Request Modification Tips
- Right-click for context menu options
- Use decoder for encoding/decoding
- Compare requests using Comparer tool
- Save interesting requests to project

## Constraints and Guardrails

### Operational Boundaries
- Test only authorized applications
- Configure scope to prevent accidental out-of-scope testing
- Rate-limit scans to avoid denial of service
- Document all findings and actions

### Technical Limitations
- Community Edition lacks automated scanner
- Some sites may block proxy traffic
- HSTS/certificate pinning may require additional configuration
- Heavy scanning may trigger WAF blocks

### Best Practices
- Always set target scope before extensive testing
- Use Burp's browser for reliable interception
- Save project regularly to preserve work
- Review scan results manually for false positives

## Examples

### Example 1: Business Logic Testing

**Scenario**: E-commerce price manipulation

1. Add item to cart normally, intercept request
2. Identify `price=9999` parameter in POST body
3. Modify to `price=1`
4. Forward request
5. Complete checkout at manipulated price

**Finding**: Server trusts client-provided price values.

### Example 2: Authentication Bypass

**Scenario**: Testing login form

1. Submit valid credentials, capture request in Repeater
2. Send to Repeater for testing
3. Try: `username=admin' OR '1'='1'--`
4. Observe successful login response

**Finding**: SQL injection in authentication.

### Example 3: Information Disclosure

**Scenario**: Error-based information gathering

1. Navigate to product page, observe `productId` parameter
2. Send request to Repeater
3. Change `productId=1` to `productId=test`
4. Observe verbose error revealing framework version

**Finding**: Apache Struts 2.5.12 disclosed in stack trace.

## Troubleshooting

### Browser Not Connecting Through Proxy
- Verify proxy listener is active (Proxy > Options)
- Check browser proxy settings point to 127.0.0.1:8080
- Ensure no firewall blocking local connections
- Use Burp's embedded browser for reliable setup

### HTTPS Interception Failing
- Install Burp CA certificate in browser/system
- Navigate to http://burp to download certificate
- Add certificate to trusted roots
- Restart browser after installation

### Slow Performance
- Limit scope to reduce processing
- Disable unnecessary extensions
- Increase Java heap size in startup options
- Close unused Burp tabs and features

### Requests Not Being Intercepted
- Verify "Intercept on" is enabled
- Check intercept rules aren't filtering target
- Ensure browser is using Burp proxy
- Verify target isn't using unsupported protocol
