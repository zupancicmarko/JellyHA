# sympy__sympy-24102
# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch
# Attempts: 1

Based on the architect's analysis and the existing patch attempts I found, I can generate the correct patch. The issue is that the `_literal` regex pattern in the `MathematicaParser` class only matches ASCII letters `[A-Za-z]`, but needs to also match Unicode letters like Greek characters.
