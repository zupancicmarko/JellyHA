# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch
# Attempts: 1

Based on my analysis of the issue and the architect's guidance, I need to generate a patch for the SymPy repository. The issue is that Float objects with identical `_mpf_` tuples (representing the same mathematical value) are not being recognized as equal, preventing proper term combination in Add operations.

The fix should ensure that Float objects with identical `_mpf_` representations hash and compare equally. Here's the patch:

Wait, let me reconsider. The real issue according to the architect is that Floats with identical `_mpf_` values are failing equality comparison when they shouldn't be. Looking more carefully at the problem:

When `expr1 - expr2` is computed:
- `expr1 = 0.5*x**2.5` has exponent Float(2.5)
- `expr2 = 0.5*x**(5/2)` after evalf has exponent Float(2.5)

The `_mpf_` tuples should be identical. The issue is likely in the hash function - if two Float objects have the same `_mpf_` but different hashes, they won't be combined as like terms.
