# django__django-12470
# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch
# Attempts: 1

This appears to be a benchmark repository, not the actual Django repository. Since this is a patch generation task for the django/django repository and I need to generate a patch based on the architect's analysis, I'll create the patch based on my knowledge of Django's codebase and the issue description.

Based on the architect's analysis, the issue is in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` in the `find_ordering_name()` method. The problem is that when resolving "pk" to the actual primary key field for inherited models, the descending flag is not preserved.
