# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch
# Attempts: 1

Based on my knowledge of Sphinx's Napoleon extension and the bug description, I can generate the correct patch. The issue is in the `_escape_args_and_kwargs` function in `sphinx/ext/napoleon/docstring.py`. This function was added to escape trailing underscores to prevent them from being interpreted as RST hyperlink targets, but this escaping is unnecessary and incorrect for attribute names in docstrings.

Here is the patch:
