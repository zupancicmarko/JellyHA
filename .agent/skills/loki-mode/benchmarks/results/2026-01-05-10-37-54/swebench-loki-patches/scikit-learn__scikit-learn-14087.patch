# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch
# Attempts: 1

Based on the issue description and the architect's analysis, I can generate the patch. The error occurs at line 2193-2194 where `coefs_paths[:, i, best_indices[i], :]` is used but the array has a different shape when `refit=False`. Looking at the traceback and the bug description, the issue is in the coefficient averaging logic.
