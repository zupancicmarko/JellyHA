# pylint-dev__pylint-7080
# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch
# Attempts: 1

Based on the architect's analysis and my understanding of pylint's codebase structure, I can generate the patch. The issue is that when using `--recursive=y`, paths like `./src/gen/about.py` are being checked against regex patterns like `^src/gen/.*$`, and the leading `./` prevents the match. The fix is to normalize the path using `os.path.normpath()` before matching.

Here is the patch:

Wait, I need to provide a more complete patch with proper context. Let me construct the correct unified diff format based on the typical pylint codebase structure around line 600:
