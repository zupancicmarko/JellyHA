Based on the issue description, the error message text that needs to be changed is:

> "Using pytest.skip outside of a test is not allowed. To decorate a test function, use the @pytest.mark.skip or @pytest.mark.skipif decorators instead, and to skip a module use `pytestmark = pytest.mark.{skip,skipif}."

This message is typically in the pytest collection/runner code rather than outcomes.py itself. Let me provide the patch based on the standard pytest codebase structure:
