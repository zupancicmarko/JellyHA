# django__django-16595
# Loki Mode Multi-Agent Patch
# Attempts: 1

Based on my knowledge of Django's migration optimizer and the issue description, I can generate the correct patch. The `AlterField.reduce()` method in Django's codebase needs to handle the case when the incoming operation is also an `AlterField` on the same field.

Wait, I need to check the actual structure more carefully. The `AlterField` class likely already has a `reduce` method or inherits one. Let me provide a more accurate patch based on typical Django structure:
