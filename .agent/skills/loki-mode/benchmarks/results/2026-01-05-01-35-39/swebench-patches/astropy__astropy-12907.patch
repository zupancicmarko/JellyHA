Based on my knowledge of the astropy codebase and this bug, I can provide the fix. The issue is in the `_cstack` function in `astropy/modeling/separable.py`. When handling CompoundModels with the `&` operator, the code incorrectly computes the separability matrix for nested compound models because it doesn't properly handle the case where the left or right operand is itself a CompoundModel.

The bug is specifically in the `_cstack` function which handles the `&` operator. When it encounters a nested CompoundModel, it should use the separability matrix of that model rather than creating a matrix of all ones.

Here's the fix based on my knowledge of the astropy codebase:

-        cright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = 1
+        cright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = right
 
     return np.hstack([cleft, cright])
```

Wait, let me reconsider the exact fix. The issue is that when `right` is already a matrix (from a nested CompoundModel), the code sets all values to 1 instead of preserving the actual separability information. The same issue exists for `left`. Let me provide the complete fix:
