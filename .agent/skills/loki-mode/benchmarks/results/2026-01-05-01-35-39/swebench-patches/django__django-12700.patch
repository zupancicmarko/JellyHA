Now I understand the issue. The `cleanse_setting` method in Django's `django/views/debug.py` only handles dictionary types but doesn't handle other iterables like lists and tuples. The fix needs to add support for these types to recursively cleanse sensitive values nested within them.

Based on the issue description and understanding of Django's codebase, here is the patch:
