+:setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` default change
+-------------------------------------------------
+
+In older versions, the :setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting defaults to
+``None``. With the default :setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS`, this results in
+uploaded files having different permissions depending on their size. If a file
+is smaller than :setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE`, it will be streamed
+from memory and be saved with the system's standard umask. If it is larger,
+it will be uploaded to a temporary file and then renamed, resulting in a mode
+of ``0o600``.
+
+To avoid this inconsistency, :setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` now defaults
+to ``0o644``. If you need the previous behavior, explicitly set
+:setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` to ``None``.
