The Django source is not in this repository. I need to generate the patch based on my understanding of the issue. Based on the detailed analysis:

The issue is in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` in the `contribute_to_class` method. The regression was introduced when `hasattr` check was added to prevent overwriting user-defined methods, but it also prevents the method from being set when a child class inherits a field with choices from a parent class.

The fix is to change from `hasattr(cls, 'get_%s_display' % self.name)` to checking `'get_%s_display' % self.name not in cls.__dict__`. This way:
- User-defined overrides are preserved (they're directly in `cls.__dict__`)
- But inherited methods from parent classes are overwritten with the correct binding for the child's field
