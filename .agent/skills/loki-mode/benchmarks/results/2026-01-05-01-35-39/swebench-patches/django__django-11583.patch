Based on the issue description and the stack trace, I understand the problem. The issue is in Django's `django/utils/autoreload.py` file in the `iter_modules_and_files` function. When `path.resolve().absolute()` is called, it can throw a `ValueError: embedded null byte` error on some systems with corrupted paths or paths containing null bytes.

The fix is to wrap the `path.resolve().absolute()` call in a try-except block to catch the `ValueError` and continue processing other files.

Based on the stack trace showing line 132 in the original code:
```python
results.add(path.resolve().absolute())
```

Here's the patch:
