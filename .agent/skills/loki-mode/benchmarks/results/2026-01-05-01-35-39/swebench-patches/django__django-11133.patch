Based on my knowledge of Django's codebase and the issue description, I can provide the fix. The issue is in `django/http/response.py` in the `make_bytes` method of `HttpResponseBase`. The method needs to handle `memoryview` objects by converting them to bytes.

Looking at the issue:
1. The `make_bytes` method handles strings and bytes but not memoryview
2. When memoryview is passed, it gets converted via `str()` which gives `<memory at 0x...>` 
3. The fix is to check for memoryview and convert it to bytes using `bytes()`

Here's the patch:
