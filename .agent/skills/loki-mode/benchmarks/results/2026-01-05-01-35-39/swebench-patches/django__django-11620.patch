Based on the issue description and hints, I can construct the fix. The issue states:

1. In `django/views/debug.py`, the `technical_404_response` function performs URL resolving at line ~482
2. It only catches `Resolver404` but should catch `Http404` 
3. When `Http404` is raised in a path converter's `to_python` method, the URL resolving in `technical_404_response` raises it again, causing a 500 error instead of showing the technical 404 page

The fix is to catch `Http404` instead of `Resolver404` in the `technical_404_response` function. Here's the patch:
