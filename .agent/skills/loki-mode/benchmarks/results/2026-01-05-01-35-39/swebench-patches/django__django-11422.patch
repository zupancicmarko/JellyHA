Now I understand the issue completely. Let me create a clean patch based on my analysis. The issue is that `manage.py` runs as the `__main__` module, and Python sets `__spec__` to `None` for `__main__` in some cases. The current code in `iter_modules_and_files` skips modules where `__spec__` is `None`, which causes `manage.py` to not be tracked by the autoreloader.

The fix is to add special handling for the `__main__` module before the `__spec__` check, extracting the file path from `__file__` directly.
