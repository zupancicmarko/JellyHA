This is not the Django repository. This appears to be a different project. Based on the issue description, I need to generate a patch for Django's `django/db/backends/base/creation.py` file. The issue provides the exact code that needs to be modified. Let me generate the patch based on the issue description and the hints provided.

The issue states:
1. The `deserialize_db_from_string` method needs to wrap the deserialization in a transaction
2. Based on the hints, it should also disable constraint checks like `loaddata` does

Here's the patch:
