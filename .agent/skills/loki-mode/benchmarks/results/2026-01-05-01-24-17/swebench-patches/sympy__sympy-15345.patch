Based on my knowledge of SymPy's codebase and the issue described, I need to analyze the problem:

1. The issue is that `mathematica_code(Max(x,2))` outputs `'Max(2, x)'` instead of `'Max[x,2]'`
2. The problem is that `Max` is using parentheses `()` instead of square brackets `[]` which is required by Mathematica

In SymPy's mathematica.py, there's typically:
- A `known_functions` dict that maps SymPy function names to Mathematica function names
- A `_print_Function` method that handles function printing

The issue is likely that `Max` and `Min` are not recognized as known functions, and they're falling through to a generic handler that uses parentheses instead of square brackets.

Looking at SymPy's code structure for the `Max` function - it's part of `sympy.functions.elementary.miscellaneous` and its class name is `Max`. The MCodePrinter needs to properly handle this.

The fix should add `Max` and `Min` to the known_functions mapping in mathematica.py so that they output proper Mathematica syntax with square brackets.

Let me generate the patch:
