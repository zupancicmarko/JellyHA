Based on the issue description and the hints provided, I have sufficient information to generate the patch. The issue clearly states:

1. The `technical_404_response` view performs URL resolving which raises a new `Http404`
2. Only `Resolver404` is caught, not `Http404`
3. The solution is to catch `Http404` instead of `Resolver404` in `technical_404_response`

Looking at typical Django structure and the issue hints, the fix involves changing the exception handling in `technical_404_response` to catch `Http404` instead of just `Resolver404`.
