Based on my knowledge of Django's codebase and this specific issue, I can provide the fix. The issue is that `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` renders text (not an input), so the label's `for` attribute points to nothing meaningful. The fix is to override the `id_for_label` method to return `None`, which will prevent the label from having a `for` attribute.

In Django's widget system, when `id_for_label()` returns `None`, the label element won't have a `for` attribute. This is the correct behavior for non-labelable elements.
