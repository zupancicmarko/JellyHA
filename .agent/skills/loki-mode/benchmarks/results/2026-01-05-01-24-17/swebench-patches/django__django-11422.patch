Based on my knowledge of Django and the issue description, I can construct the patch. The issue is in the `iter_modules_and_files` function in `django/utils/autoreload.py`. The problem is that when a module is `__main__` (like `manage.py`), its `__spec__` attribute is `None`, so it gets skipped by the current logic.

The fix needs to handle the `__main__` module specially by checking for `__file__` attribute when `__spec__` is `None`.

Looking at the regression commit mentioned (c8720e7696ca41f3262d5369365cc1bd72a216ca) and the issue hints, the fix should:
1. Check if the module is `__main__` and has a `__file__` attribute
2. If so, include that file in the watched files

Here's the patch:
