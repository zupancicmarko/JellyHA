Based on the issue description, I need to create a patch that fixes the hint message in Django's code. The issue states:
1. There's a hint that incorrectly says `ForeignKey("%s", symmetrical=False, through="%s")` 
2. But `symmetrical` and `through` are ManyToManyField arguments, not ForeignKey arguments
3. Also, `symmetrical=False` is no longer required since Django 3.0

Let me search for this in a Django repository. Since the current directory doesn't contain Django code, I'll construct the patch based on my knowledge of Django's codebase structure. The error message is typically in the `django/db/models/fields/related.py` file or in the field checks module.

Based on the Django codebase and the error description, this hint message is located in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` in the section that checks ManyToManyField configurations. The fix should:
1. Change `ForeignKey` to `ManyToManyField` 
2. Remove `symmetrical=False` since it's no longer required in Django 3.0+

Here's the patch:
