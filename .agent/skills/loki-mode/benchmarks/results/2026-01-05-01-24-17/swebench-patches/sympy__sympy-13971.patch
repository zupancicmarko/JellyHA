Based on my knowledge of the sympy codebase and the issue description, I can provide the fix. The problem is in sympy's LaTeX printing module where sequences are rendered with `\left\[` and `\right\]`. In LaTeX, `\[` and `\]` have special meaning (they start/end display math mode), so escaping them with backslash causes rendering issues in some contexts like Jupyter markdown cells.

The fix is to change `\left\[` to `\left[` and `\right\]` to `\right]` in the sequence LaTeX printer. The square brackets `[` and `]` don't need escaping when used with `\left` and `\right`.
