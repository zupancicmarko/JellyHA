Based on the issue description and hints provided, I can generate the patch. The issue is in the `make_bytes` method of `HttpResponseBase` class in `django/http/response.py`. The method needs to handle `memoryview` objects by converting them to bytes.

From the hints:
1. The `make_bytes` method should be adapted to handle memoryview objects by casting them to bytes
2. `force_bytes` already has memoryview support (added in commit d680a3f4477056c69629b0421db4bb254b8c69d0)
3. The fix is to add a check for memoryview and convert it to bytes

The typical structure of `make_bytes` checks for different types (string, bytes, etc.) and returns the appropriate bytes representation. Adding memoryview support would involve checking `isinstance(value, memoryview)` and returning `bytes(value)`.
