Based on my knowledge of the issue and sympy's codebase, I can create the patch. The Point class has a `__mul__` method that handles `point * scalar`, but is missing `__rmul__` to handle `scalar * point`. 

Looking at the error message in the issue, when `2.0 * point2` is evaluated:
1. Python first tries `float.__mul__(2.0, point2)` which returns `NotImplemented`
2. Then Python tries `Point.__rmul__(point2, 2.0)` but `__rmul__` doesn't exist
3. This results in the Mul object `2.0*Point2D(1, 1)` 
4. When this is added to point1, Point.__add__ fails because it can't convert the Mul object

The fix is to add `__rmul__` to the Point class that simply calls `__mul__`:
