This repository doesn't contain the Django codebase. Let me understand the issue better and provide a patch based on my knowledge of Django's code structure. The issue is about the `cleanse_setting` method in `django/views/debug.py` which needs to recursively cleanse settings in lists and tuples, not just dictionaries.

Based on the Django issue description, I need to create a patch that:
1. Handles lists and tuples in addition to dictionaries when cleansing settings
2. Recursively cleanses sensitive values within nested data structures

Here's the patch:
