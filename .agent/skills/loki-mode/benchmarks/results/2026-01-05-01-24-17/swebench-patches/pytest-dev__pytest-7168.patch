This is not the pytest repository. I need to work on the pytest-dev/pytest repository. Since this is a GitHub issue about pytest, I need to understand the issue from the traceback and create a patch for the `saferepr.py` file.

Let me analyze the issue from the problem statement:

1. The issue is in `_pytest/_io/saferepr.py`
2. The problem occurs when `obj.__class__.__name__` is accessed, but the object has a broken `__getattribute__` method
3. The fix should change `obj.__class__.__name__` to `type(obj).__name__` to avoid calling the object's `__getattribute__`

Based on the traceback, I can see the relevant code that needs to be fixed is in `_format_repr_exception` at line 23:
```python
exc_info, obj.__class__.__name__, id(obj)
```

This should be changed to:
```python
exc_info, type(obj).__name__, id(obj)
```

Here's the patch:
