Based on the problem statement and hint, I can understand the issue:

1. The `col_insert` method inserts columns into a matrix
2. There's a bug where the position calculation is wrong in the `_eval_col_insert` method
3. According to the hint, `pos` shouldn't be at line 89

Looking at the GitHub issue and the problem description:
- When inserting columns at position 3 in a 6x6 identity matrix, the resulting matrix incorrectly shifts part of the original matrix
- The 3x3 identity portion that should be at the bottom-right is incorrectly placed at the top-right

The issue is in the `_eval_col_insert` method in `sympy/matrices/common.py`. Looking at similar issues and the sympy codebase structure, the bug is that when calculating indices for the entries after the insertion point, the code incorrectly uses `pos` when it should use a different value.

The typical implementation would have something like:
```python
def _eval_col_insert(self, pos, other):
    cols = self.cols
    
    def entry(i, j):
        if j < pos:
            return self[i, j]
        elif pos <= j < pos + other.cols:
            return other[i, j - pos]
        return self[i, j - other.cols]  # Bug was here: using pos instead of other.cols
```

The fix is that when accessing elements from the original matrix after the inserted columns, we need to offset by `other.cols` (the number of columns being inserted), not by `pos` (the insertion position).

Based on the structure of sympy's matrix code and the hint pointing to line 89, here's the patch:
