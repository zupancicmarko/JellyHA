Based on the GitHub issue, I need to generate a patch for Flask's `Config.from_file()` method. The issue asks to add a file mode parameter (suggested as `text=True`) to allow opening files in binary mode for `tomllib.load()` compatibility.

Based on my knowledge of Flask's codebase and the issue discussion, here is the patch:
