Based on the issue, I need to analyze the SymPy code and generate a patch. The issue occurs in `fu.py` at line 504 where there's a comparison `if (rv.exp < 0) == True:` that fails when the exponent is a complex number like `I`.

Let me look at the traceback more carefully:

1. The issue is in `/sympy/simplify/fu.py` at line 504
2. The comparison `(rv.exp < 0)` fails when `rv.exp` is `I` (the imaginary unit)
3. This is because you cannot compare complex numbers with real numbers using `<` or `>`

The fix should check if the exponent is a real number before doing the comparison, or handle the case where the comparison raises a TypeError. Looking at the error and the context:

```python
if (rv.exp < 0) == True:
```

The issue is that when `rv.exp` is `I`, the comparison `rv.exp < 0` raises a TypeError because you can't compare complex numbers.

The fix should add a check to ensure the exponent is comparable (i.e., it's real or at least extended real) before attempting the comparison. In SymPy, you can use `rv.exp.is_real` or check `rv.exp.is_extended_real` to determine if the comparison is valid.

Looking at the pattern from the traceback, the `_TR56` function in `fu.py` has a helper function `_f` that does this comparison. The fix should modify this comparison to handle the case where the exponent is not real.
