Based on the issue description and the hints provided, I have enough information to generate the patch. The issue is clear:

1. `TRmorrie` transforms expressions in a way that `TR10i` can no longer recognize
2. The fix is to swap the order of `TRmorrie` and `TR10i` so that `TR10i` runs first

Looking at the issue hints which reference line 1131-1164 in sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py, and the explanation that these transformations are called sequentially with `TRmorrie` before `TR10i`, the fix is to change this order.

Based on sympy's codebase structure (the `fu` module contains transformation functions like `TRmorrie` and `TR10i`), the relevant code in trigsimp.py likely defines composition functions like:

```python
CTR3 = (lambda x: TRmorrie(x), lambda x: TR10i(x), ...)
```

The fix should swap these so `TR10i` comes before `TRmorrie`.

Looking at sympy's actual code structure for this (based on standard sympy patterns and the issue description), here's the patch:
