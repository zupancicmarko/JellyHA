Based on my knowledge of the Django issue and the stacktrace provided, I can create the fix. The issue is in `django/utils/autoreload.py` in the `iter_modules_and_files` function where `path.resolve().absolute()` is called. When pathlib encounters a null byte in a path during resolution, it throws a `ValueError: embedded null byte`. The fix is to catch this exception and continue processing other files.

Looking at the stacktrace:
- Line 132: `results.add(path.resolve().absolute())`

The fix should wrap the `path.resolve().absolute()` call in a try-except block to catch `ValueError` (for embedded null byte errors).

Here's the patch:
