Based on my knowledge of the sympy codebase and the issue described, the problem is in the `Intersection` class's `__new__` method in `sympy/sets/sets.py`. The issue is that when duplicate arguments are passed, they're not being properly deduplicated before processing, which leads to incorrect evaluation.

Here's the patch:
