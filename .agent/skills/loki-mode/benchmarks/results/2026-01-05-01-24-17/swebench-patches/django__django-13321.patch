This repository doesn't seem to contain the Django source code. This is a different project. The issue is about Django's session handling. Let me understand the issue better and write a patch based on the traceback information provided.

Looking at the issue, the problem is in `django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py`. The `_legacy_decode` method is called when the normal decode fails, but `_legacy_decode` itself can fail with `binascii.Error: Incorrect padding` when the session data is corrupted or invalid.

The fix should catch this exception and return an empty dictionary (like other decode errors), rather than letting it propagate and crash the application.

Based on the traceback:
1. Line 118: `decode()` tries `signing.loads()` which fails with `BadSignature`
2. Line 122: Falls back to `_legacy_decode()`
3. Line 126 in `_legacy_decode`: `base64.b64decode()` fails with `binascii.Error: Incorrect padding`

The fix should wrap the `_legacy_decode` method to handle `binascii.Error` exceptions and return an empty session dictionary.

Let me look at the commit referenced in the hints: `d4fff711d4c97356bd6ba1273d2a5e349326eb5f` which caused the regression.

Based on my understanding of the Django session code and the issue description, here's the patch:
