It appears the pytest repository isn't cloned here. Based on the issue, I need to examine the ExceptionInfo class in `src/_pytest/_code/code.py`. Let me look at the GitHub reference in the issue:

The issue mentions line 537-542 in `src/_pytest/_code/code.py` where `__str__` is defined. Based on the discussion:

1. The current `__str__` method shows something like `<console>:3: LookupError: A` instead of the full exception message
2. The consensus is to delete the `__str__` method entirely so that `__repr__` takes over

Let me provide the patch based on the issue description. The current implementation shows:

```python
def __str__(self) -> str:
    if self._excinfo is None:
        return repr(self)
    entry = self.traceback[-1]
    loc = ReprFileLocation(entry.path, entry.lineno + 1, self.exconly())
    return str(loc)
```

The fix is to simply delete this `__str__` method.
