This appears to be a task about creating a patch for the Django repository. Based on the issue description and hint provided, I need to create a patch that adds `template_name = "django/forms/div.html"` to the `ManagementForm` class in `django/forms/formsets.py` to avoid the deprecation warning.

Based on the issue description and the hint provided, here's the patch:

--- a/django/forms/formsets.py
+++ b/django/forms/formsets.py
