Based on the issue description, I have enough context to generate the patch. The issue is that `SimpleLazyObject` in Django's `django/utils/functional.py` doesn't implement `__radd__`. The solution suggested in the issue comments is to use `new_method_proxy(lambda a, b: operator.add(b, a))`.

Let me look at what the typical Django functional.py file looks like based on my knowledge:

--- a/django/utils/functional.py
+++ b/django/utils/functional.py
@@ -82,6 +82,7 @@ class LazyObject:
     __bytes__ = new_method_proxy(bytes)
     __str__ = new_method_proxy(str)
     __bool__ = new_method_proxy(bool)
+    __radd__ = new_method_proxy(lambda a, b: b + a)
 
     # Introspection support
     __dir__ = new_method_proxy(dir)
