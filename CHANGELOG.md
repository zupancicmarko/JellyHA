# Changelog

All notable changes to JellyHA will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.1] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **External URL Support**: Added an optional configuration setting for users running Jellyfin in clusters to override the UI base link, ensuring "Open in Jellyfin" actions remain working across public endpoints.
- **Russian Translation**: Extensive frontend and backend translation coverage provided for the Russian language.
- **Refresh Interval Dropdown**: Upgraded the Library Refresh Interval setting from a raw seconds slider to a human-readable dropdown format (e.g. `5 minutes`, `1 hour`).
- **Now Playing Card Updates**:
  - Added elapsed/remaining time display.
  - Added user name information and client details formatting.
  - Added specific Artist and Series name support for Music and TV shows.
  - Added interactive scrubbable progress bar: Drag to seek with real-time visual tracking before committing the jump.
  - Added Shuffle and Repeat buttons for music playback directly in the UI.
  - Added visual `-10s` rewind and `+30s` fast-forward controls for video media.
  - Added stop-pulse animation and comprehensive haptic vibration feedback for mobile.

### Changed
- Improved Now Playing card visuals with dot separators, dynamic colors extracted from posters, glassmorphic progress bar, and refined spacing.
- **Overlay Layouts**: Replaced harsh drop-shadows with a soft 5-point ambient vignette scale (70% opacity -> transparent -> 70% opacity) across all portrait/compact views.
- **Text Alignment**: Enforced a native 6px margin to perfectly normalize text baseline across all grid row constraints (3-row, 4-row).
- **Improved Alignment**: Progress bar timestamps now perfectly align with the bar edges.
- **Card Styling**: Removed title/subtitle text shadows and flattened progress bar edges for a cleaner look.
- **Better Text Handling**: Allowed long titles to wrap to multiple lines instead of using ellipsis.
- **Compact Layouts**: Overlaid title and subtitle directly on the poster with heavier top/bottom gradients, adjusted typography natively using the dominant dynamic colors, and fixed hover scaling to naturally zoom the entire poster.
- **Typography & Clean-up**: Reduced the base card title font size from `1.4rem` to `1.3rem`, removed italics from the subtitle with an opacity boost to `0.8`, and ensured hidden `poster-badges` in the smallest container queries.
- **Status Badges**: Updated the REWINDING/PLAYING/BUFFERING status badge to a unified frosted glass pill design on both Now Playing and Library cards with perfectly vertically-centered typography.
- **Colors**: Improved dynamic color extraction for the Now Playing card title by raising the minimum lightness threshold to 70%, guaranteeing readability against dark backdrops.
- **Colors**: Replaced the primary theme color with solid white for the release year on the Library Card hover overlay.

### Fixed
- **Empty Setup Dropout**: Fixed an issue where initial setup or reconfiguration would crash if the user did not have standard `movies` or `tvshows` library types (added fallback to `mixed`, `musicvideos` and `homevideos`, protected against completely empty dropdowns).
- **Setup API Headers**: Fixed a double keyword argument error crashing the setup flow logout cleanup routine.
- **Item Details Modal**: Fixed a bug where favorited status was not correctly displayed in the "More Information" card when opened from lists.
- **Progress Bar**: Fixed the immediate snap-back effect when manually jumping or scrubbing the progress bar by optimistically holding the new position for 3 seconds while awaiting the server update.
- **Stop Pulse**: Fixed a bug where the long-press stop shadow-pulse effect rendered as a square instead of a circle.
- **Loading Spinner**: Fixed the loading spinner shrinking during rewind/seek actions, now properly maintaining the 44px play/pause button size.
